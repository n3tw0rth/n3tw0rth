#### Hey,

I'm interested in low-level programming and exploring the internals of software systems.
I work as a Software Engineer on Backends and Cloud environments, and in my free time, I enjoy:

- 🛠️ Building terminal tools.
- 📚 Learning new things.
- 🌱 And i do tissue culture (Anubias, Monstera, Philodendron)
